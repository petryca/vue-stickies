# Vue Stickies AI Improvement Challenge

This code contains Vue Stickies front-end app from the previous assignment. Your challenge is to implement User Iterface improvements listed below. Use an AI tool to help you with this. Develop, test and iterate until you achive the desired functionality.

1. Move the PLUS button to the end of the stickies array
2. When the app opens for the first time, make sure there is one taxtarea that exists.
3. Create new taxtarea ONLY if the tab key is pressed in the last taxtarea, else just move the focus to the next taxtarea (end of text)
4. Give focus to newly created taxtarea, and also give focus to the last taxtarea (at the end of text) if the previous last textarea has just been deleted
5. New note is created with random color
6. The placeholder text appears only on the FIRST textarea
7. Format the placeholder text into bullet points (use \n for newline)
8. Use left and right arrow keys to navigate between textareas
