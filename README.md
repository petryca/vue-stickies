# Vue Stickies AI Improvement Challenge

This code contains the complete Vue Stickies front-end app from the previous assignment. Your challenge is to implement the UI improvements listed below. Use an AI tool to help you with this.

1. Move the PLUS button to the end of the stickies array
2. When the app opens for the first time, make sure there is one stickie that exists.
3. Create new textarea ONLY if the tab key is pressed in the last textarea, else just move the focus to the next textarea (end of text)
4. Give focus to newly created textarea, and also give focus to the last taxtarea (at the end of text) if the previous last textarea has just been deleted
5. New note is created with random color
6. The placeholder text appears only on the FIRST textarea
